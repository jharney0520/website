I am a current PhD Student in Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. My research interests are in criminal justice system reform with a specific focus on mental health and improving outcomes for those whose lives are impacted by the carceral system. My current projects are on correctional officer coping mechanisms (manuscript forthcoming) and empathy for incarcerated individuals.
